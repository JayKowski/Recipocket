## How the App works

it's pretty much straight forward!

Right on the landing page, a user is met by two search types. 
Category and Meal.
The category search contains a drop down menu that lets the user search for meals from a certain category,
while the meal search lets a user search for a specific meal by name.

While the meal search returns a single Meal preview bubble, the Category search renders a Meal Preview bubble for every meal retrieved from the given category.

clicking the "see more" button or on the Meal Preview image itself will direct the user to another "page" (this is a single-page application) that displays the 
information about the Meal. Information entails the meal's ingredients (with respective measurements) and the instructions to prepare the meal.
