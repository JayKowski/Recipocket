# Recipocket 🍽
Recipocket, Many recipies in one place 😋🍕🍗

## About the project

## Live Link

<!-- [Bunny Hop](https://bunny-hop.netlify.app) -->

## How the App works

it's pretty much straight forward!

Right on the landing page, a user is met by two search types. 
Category and Meal.
The category search contains a drop down menu that lets the user search for meals from a certain category,
while the meal search lets a user search for a specific meal by name.

While the meal search returns a single Meal preview bubble, the Category search renders a Meal Preview bubble for every meal retrieved from the given category.

clicking the "see more" button or on the Meal Preview image itself will direct the user to another "page" (this is a single-page application) that displays the 
information about the Meal. Information entails the meal's ingredients (with respective measurements) and the instructions to prepare the meal.

## Prerequisites and instructions

If you would however fancy something more than just using the app online, you can actually download the project locally
and make any modifications of your own!

If so, please follow the given instructions.
You will need the following environments installed in your pc:

- Node Js installed

- NPM or Yarn (NPM preferable)

### Instructions 

first off, clone the repo onto your local environment:

> ```git clone https://github.com/JayKowski/endless-runner.git```

- Install the required packages with:

> ```npm install```

- Build and serve with:

> ```npx webpack```

This instance will be running at the **port 5500** in your local host.
It is also adviceable for you to have a server running HTTP as Phaser would have issues 
passing assets over a non-http server connection

I recommend live server if you're on VS Code or Atom.
it requires no other configuration and is usable just by starting live server.
